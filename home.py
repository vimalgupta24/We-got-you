Depression is one of the leading causes of disability. \n\n Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds. People with severe mental health conditions die prematurely – as much as two decades early – due to preventable physical conditions. \n Despite progress in some countries, people with mental health conditions often experience severe human rights violations, discrimination, and stigma. \n\n Many mental health conditions can be effectively treated at relatively low cost, yet the gap between people needing care and those with access to care remains substantial. Effective treatment coverage remains extremely low. \n\n Mental illnesses affect 19 % of the adult population, 46 % of teenagers and 13 % of children each year. People struggling with their mental health may be in your family, live next door, teach your children, work in the next cubicle or sit in the same church pew.\n\n However, only half of those affected receive treatment, often because of the stigma attached to mental health. Untreated, mental illness can contribute to higher medical expenses, poorer performance at school and work, fewer employment opportunities and increased risk of suicide.")
