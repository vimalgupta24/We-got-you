You may have trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn't worth living. \n More than just a bout of the blues, depression isn't a weakness and you can't simply SNAP OUT of it. Depression may require long-term treatment. But don't get discouraged. \n Most people with depression feel better with medication, psychotherapy or both.Depression can make you feel alone but you have lots of company.
